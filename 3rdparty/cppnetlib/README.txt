C++ Network Library

This is a collection of network related routines/implementations
geared towards providing a robust cross-platform networking library.
This offers the following implementations:

  o  Common Message Type -- A generic message type which can be used
     to encapsulate and store message related information, used by all
     network implementations as the primary means of data exchange.
  o  Network protocol message parsers -- A collection of parsers which
     generate message objects from strings.
  o  Adapters and Wrappers -- A collection of Adapters and wrappers aimed
     towards making the message type STL friendly.
