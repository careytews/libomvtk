The OpenMetaVerse ToolKit Library 

The OpenMetaVerse ToolKit Library is a Library for accessing virtual worlds
such as Second Life Grid(TM) [1] created by Linden Lab/Linden Research, Inc[2],
and OpenSim based virtual worlds such as OSgrid[3] and Openlife grid[4]

Our main target is to offer an API for compiled languages such as C or C++
Whilst the core is developed in C++ and the latest API our plan is to offer
a C API to this library so it will be easily possible to created bindings
for other languages such as Python, Perl, Ruby, Pascal, Delphi a.s.o.
